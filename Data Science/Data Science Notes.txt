give 'examples' to 'machine', machine would come up with logic

ML systems learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on never-before-seen data

What are we predicting? Label is the true thing we're predicting: y (The y variable in basic linear regression)

Y is predicted based on what? It is predicted based on features of the examples. Features are input variables (x) describing our data. The {x1, x2, ... xn} variables in basic linear regression.

Example is a particular instance of data.

Labeled example has {features, label}: (x, y) - Used to train the model
Unlabeled example has {features, ?}: (x, ?) - Used for making predictions on new data
